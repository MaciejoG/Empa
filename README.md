Time-series simulation of a heating system with and without grey water heat recovery

Basement_model_function contains set of equations used in the simulation files Basement_model and Basement_model_without_gw. These files simulate the thermal performance and temperatures distributions over one year for systems with and without grey water heat recovery, respectively.

Data for the model is taken from the excel fil.

See the output plots in the plots folder, as well as the full project documentation in the Documentation.pdf
